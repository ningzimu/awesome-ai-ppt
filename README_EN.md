A curated list of open-source projects for AI-assisted presentation generation, PowerPoint automation, PPTX editing, and slide workflow tooling.

This is a curated list, not a dump of every slide-related link. It focuses on GitHub repositories and technical projects that help agents or developers create, edit, convert, or inspect presentations.

## Scope

Included projects should have a direct relationship to AI-assisted presentation work: generating slides, editing PPTX files, converting content into presentations, reconstructing editable decks, or rendering and validating slides.

Categories are based on the source representation of the main workflow, not the final export format. PPTX export does not automatically make a project PPTX-native; `Skill`, `editable PPTX`, and `PPTX export` are tags, not category decisions.

GitHub repositories should have at least 10 stars before being included.

Out of scope:

- Generic AI writing tools without a presentation workflow.
- Generic image generators without slide or deck output.
- Template marketplaces with no open repository or technical workflow.
- Archived, deprecated, or empty repositories.

Pull requests are welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before suggesting a project.
